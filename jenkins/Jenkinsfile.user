// user-service/Jenkinsfile
//
// This Jenkinsfile serves as the entry point for the 'user-service' pipeline.
// It defines service-specific context variables and loads the core CI/CD logic
// from the shared Jenkinsfile, promoting reusability and maintainability
// across all microservices in the monorepo.

// --- Service-Specific Configuration ---
// Define the unique identifier for this microservice.
// This variable is used by the shared pipeline to locate service-specific files
// (e.g., Dockerfile, Helm chart) and construct image names.
def serviceName = "user-service"

// Leverage Jenkins' built-in environment variable for the unique build number.
// This is typically used as the Docker image tag for versioning.
def buildNumber = env.BUILD_NUMBER

// --- Load Shared Pipeline Logic ---
// Load the primary pipeline definition from the shared library.
// The path 'jenkins/Jenkinsfile.shared' is relative to the Jenkins workspace root
// (which corresponds to the 'ecom-microservices-project' Git repository root).
load 'jenkins/Jenkinsfile.shared' {
    service = serviceName,
    build = buildNumber
